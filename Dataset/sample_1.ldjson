Is this the role I have been yearning for? Could it be serendipity, the law of attraction manifesting my deep-felt desires to run my own team \u2013 my way? Yes it is! If you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re a digital media Rockstar, stop reading right now. This is NOT the role for you. We are not looking for a trainee or even someone eager to \u201clearn the ropes\u201d. We\u2019re looking for a Digital Media Rockstar who wants the ultimate platform to leverage your skills growing our consultancy five-fold over the next 5 years and be paid handsomely for that accomplishment, as a rockstar should. Let\u2019s get past the necessary details: We\u2019re looking for a driven, entrepreneurial and results-focused Head Of Media to build a team of media buyers across offline and online channels by contributing your market-beating digital media skills to the team. You need to master metrics, be focused on client ROI, thrive working in the fast-paced, dynamic environment of digital media with an insatiable appetite to expanding your career into full campaign management and activations beyond the media buying function. You have to totally master the digital media buying space. It would help if you\u2019ve previously worked in one of the following roles: sales, advertising, digital marketing, account management or consulting since you\u2019ll be able to put those valuable business skills to use across the 4 dimensions of our client value proposition (more on that below). You have to have five or more years of digital media buying experience. If you don\u2019t have that, stop reading now, we\u2019re not going to consider you. To HEAD our media division and lead it to the next level of performance as we continue to integrate it across all the divisions, we need a real \u201cRockstar\u201d. The reason you\u2019d want to leave where you are now is to spread your wings. We don\u2019t operate in silos, we fully integrate across 4 dimensions of communications: Media, creative design, marketing automation & intelligence. That is how/why we can create market-beating results. Now would be a good time to let you know what our Unique Selling Proposition is: We\u2019re relentless trailblazers on the leading edge, delivering fully integrated data-driven media, creative design and marketing automation & intelligence by intimately collaborating with high growth brands seeking long-lasting market-beating results from an infectiously passionate team. As our Head Of Media Rockstar, you\u2019ll need to explore the leading edge of technology, channels to remain at the forefront of the latest and greatest innovations \u2013 we call this marketing intelligence, which we can discuss with you \u2013 if you make the short list. Let\u2019s face it, this role will be exciting if you\u2019re bored just executing buy orders all day long with little to no interaction with anyone else, completely disconnected with the other components of the marketing funnel, campaign and end-to-end customer experience. Even though we know you\u2019re a Rockstar, we know this role will challenge you to think holistically across our 4 dimensions to fully appreciate each component that creates value and amazing results are clients have come to expect and appreciate us for. This is how you\u2019ll stretch your craft, it\u2019s the next logical step in your career. It\u2019s what has been frustrating you. As a media Rockstar, you know the importance of forming amazing relationships with media publishers at all levels to drive real market-beating ROI results. Your \u201ccan-do\u201d attitude embraces new ideas you know means being involved in the detail of the campaign activations to fully control the deliverables to the client and optimise dynamically, in real-time. That ios your greatest skill, your ability to assess the numbers and make the small tweaks that create big results. As a Rockstar, you know and appreciate your band members. You know that working collaboratively with Client Success Managers is key because they are at the coal face with clients and are your direct link to what\u2019s happening on the client side of the equation. Because you\u2019re a legitimate Rockstar mastering your craft \u2013 you won\u2019t be micromanaged you will have full control and authority to make both the strategic as well as tactical decisions you know will make the difference within each context. That is your magic \u2013 knowing the nuances across industries and markets. You know how to construct the perfect \u201cset\u201d for each audience. You know the ultimate goal is always increasing sales \u2013 as profitably as possible. The mix of traditional and digital media is more art than science, but is always validated with the bottom line results. Contrary to what you might have experienced previously, we don\u2019t just want your input, we will be constantly asking you for contributions, insights and ideas without our self-organising team structure. If you\u2019re currently bored with repetitive tasks, office politics and bureaucracy and feel like you\u2019ve been pigeonholed, come spread your wings with us. We have no office politics, hierarchical issues or sacred cows. We run a self-organising team that is highly productive, where the best ideas win. We play no favourites. The more practical, original and profitable your contributions are, the more valued and respected you will become. Our success comes from our relentless focus on bottom-line results. Our clients are loyal to us because we deliver on every campaign and KEEP over-delivering on the (reasonable) promises we make to them. We\u2019ve just entered a high growth phase and need new talent\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  We\u2019re growing quickly and that means you have the unique chance to really step in and make this role your own. To jump right in and expand it based on your level of drive and ambition. Your mission will be to track down and identify the most suitable and cost-effective channels and platforms to help our clients reach highly-segmented audiences across B2B and B2C sectors. You need to be a great negotiator. We establish long-term relationships with all our suppliers and publishers, which means the outcomes need to be win-win-win. We win, the suppliers win and our clients win with the best possible combination, offer, package and/or placement(s) available in market. You need to be data-driven and have an analytical streak, even be a geek or nerd when it comes to Doubleclick and other technologies. In the heat of the campaigns, you need to be able to crunch numbers quickly to optimise the various components to maximise conversions while simultaneously minimising costs. To thrive in this role, you need to appreciate that clients seek media space for different reasons. Some clients look to drive brand engagement or product awareness, while some want lead generation while others want more paying customers to buy. As Head Of Media you will create tailor-made solutions to fit each client\u2019s goals, objectives, preferences and budgets. You need to be driven to help clients achieve their objectives  To be crystal clear about the skills you must have, you need to master the DoubleClick Digital Marketing (DDM) platform to create, manage and grow data-driven marketing campaigns across a wide range of web platforms. You must be able to integrate both Google AdWords and Facebook Ads to track, monitor and manage the customer journeys / experiences from end-to-end. You must be continually evolving to stay abreast of industry trends because media buying is a fast-changing space. What worked six months ago might not work today. That\u2019s why you have to keep reading, networking, refining and updating your skills to stay ahead of emerging distribution channel and technological trends.\u00a0 We describe ourselves as a media communications consultancy \u2013 not an agency because we go beyond the buying function to fully integrate the 4 dimensions of communications: Media, creative design, marketing automation & intelligence. By so doing, we also differentiate ourselves by making money FOR our clients rather than FROM our clients. This is more than a slogan, it\u2019s a core foundational principle that underpins EVERYTHING we do.

UEC is able to over-deliver on expectations by being the conductor to an orchestra of moving parts that create a symphony of results that resonate with highly targeted audiences across both B2B and B2C sectors. The composition begins with expert media buying that requires establishing a key strategic proportion between traditional offline and digital media spending. Once the budget allocation is defined, it then proceeds to tactical deployment of funds across the selected channels to ensure target market optimisation to set the stage for everything that follows. The second act is to create design elements specifically tailored to each of the channels to ensure optimal conversions while providing coherent maximum brand reinforcement. The collaboration and synchronisation of media and creative design is one of the reasons UEC out-performs its peers as well as internal marketing departments. The third act builds on this momentum to integrate lead generation and client acquisition activities to feed into a cohesive customer journey that provides a higher conversion on their path to purchase. This is enabled with sophisticated automated workflows that create and enhance the customer experience, reducing attrition at or immediately following a purchase as well as substantially improving customer satisfaction during the consumption of the product or service. This inevitably reduces operational costs. Even though UEC is focused on media, sales and marketing, the systemisation of multiple customer journeys translates into organisational improvements that further create benefits with economies of scale. These improvements often provide the much-needed capacity to grow quickly without substantial additional and costly human resources. The last act builds to a crescendo by embracing leading-edge technologies including: artificial intelligence, machine learning, heuristics, predictive modelling and data analytics to fully embrace the concept of deliberate practice principles that have created Olympic medallists and World Champions. This complex process involves creating a self-reinforcing feedback loop that automatically and systematically applies highly sophisticated mathematics and statistical techniques to optimise all the moving components, so we can manage, monitor and adjust each variable in harmony with the others to maximise profits at the minimum cost while sustaining the highest quality and brand integrity. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Please submit your application today -we are hiring now for immediate placement.","job_type":"Full Time","salary_offered":"$100,000 - $149,999 Depending on your experience","job_board":"seek","geo":"AU","job_post_lang":"en","inferred_iso2_lang_code":"en","inferred_iso3_lang_code":"eng","site_name":"seek_au_job_board_common_setup_pc_jobspikr","domain":"seek_com_au","postdate_yyyymmdd":"20190927","has_expired":"false","last_expiry_check_date":"2019.09.29","postdate_in_indexname_format":"2019.09.21","inferred_city":"Sydney","inferred_state":"New south wales","inferred_country":"Australia","fitness_score":10}
